## 🚀 Overview

This project is a personal initiative to build a high-performance, extensible backtesting engine for algorithmic trading. It includes:

- Custom serialization for financial tick and candle data
- Modular strategy architecture
- Candle generation from ticks and lower timeframes
- Planned tick reconstruction from candles
- Multiple reporting formats
- Optimization tools for strategy scanning
- Console interface for basic interaction
- ArchiMate-based system design

---

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ **Tick & Candle Serialization**  *(in progress)*  
  Binary serialization and delta compression for both ticks and OHLC candles.

- ✅ **Candle Generation Engine**  *(planned)*
  Create candles from tick streams or aggregate lower timeframe candles.

- ✅ **Reverse Candle-to-Tick Algorithm** *(planned for extended functionality)*
  Experimental logic to reconstruct tick data from candle series.

- ✅ **Modular Strategy Framework**  
  Easily plug in strategies like Turtle Trading using a shared interface.

- ✅ **Reporting Engine** *(planned)*  
  Output results in CSV, JSON, and other formats.

- ✅ **Strategy Scanner** *(planned for extended functionality)*
  Automatically test multiple parameter sets to find optimal configurations.

- ✅ **Console App Interface** *(planned)*  
  Lightweight CLI for running backtests and viewing results.

- ✅ **ArchiMate Architecture**  
  System design modeled using ArchiMate — included in `/Docs`.

## 📈 Example Strategy: Turtle Trading *(coming soon)*

A classic trend-following strategy will be implemented as a reference module, showcasing how to integrate strategies into the engine.

---

## 📄 Documentation

All design decisions, tasks, and architecture are documented in the `/Docs` folder.  
ArchiMate diagrams will be exported and linked here once finalized.

---

## 🧪 Testing - *(soon)*

Unit tests for serialization, strategy logic, and reporting will be added in future versions.
